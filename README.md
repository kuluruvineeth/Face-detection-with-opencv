# Face-detection-with-opencv
**Feature-based face detection algorithms** are fast and effective and have been used successfully for decades.

Here the technique i used is cascade classifiers first described by **Paul Viola** and **Michael Jones** in their 2001 paper titled "[Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/990517)".

In the above paper,effective features and range of very simple or weak features in each face are learned by using the [AdaBoost algorithm](https://machinelearningmastery.com/boosting-and-adaboost-for-machine-learning/).


As Classifier Cascade face detection algorithm is provided in [OpenCV library](https://opencv.org/) i used this library to detect face in the photograph.

## Images used :
1. **single face image**

2. **multiple face image**
